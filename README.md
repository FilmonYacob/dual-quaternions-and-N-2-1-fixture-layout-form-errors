# Introduction
This project is used for part quality prediction in multistage machining processes while considering N-2-1 fixture layout and parts with form errors. To demonstrate the idea, a two stationed machining line with a 12-2-1 locators is implemented. 

# Additional Libraries
The code is dependent on the libraries below.
