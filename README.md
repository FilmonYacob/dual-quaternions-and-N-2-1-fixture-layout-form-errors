# Introduction
This project helps make part quality prediction while considering N-2-1 fixture layout and part with form errors in multistage machining processes. To demonstrate the idea, a two stationed machining line with 12-2-1 locators is implemented. 

# Additional Libraries
The code is dependent on the libraries below.
